## Problems with Docker?

With the worst case scenario, you will have to delete all the configuration,
images and containers, but sometimes simple update does the trick.

Sometimes, switching to [Podman](https://podman.io/) is the answer.

## Problems with Linux?

Please look around the internet, ask `ChatGPT`, or `StackOverflow` - `Google Search`, or `Bing.com`.
