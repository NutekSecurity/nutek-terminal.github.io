## Why?

Since ancient times people have been using ciphers to protect their secrets.
I think even animals have their own way of communicating with each other
without letting others know what they are talking about.

## Installation

```shell
cargo install nutek-cipher
```

or download the binary for your OS from [releases](https://github.com/nutek-terminal/nutek-cipher/releases) - Windows, Linux, MacOS

## Usage

```shell
nutek-cipher --help
```

Display help message.

Usage: nutek-cipher [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -e, --encrypt                        encrypt
  -d, --decrypt                        decrypt
  -i, --input <INPUT>                  set input file
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>                set output file
      --key-file <KEY_FILE>            key from file
      --nonce-file <NONCE_FILE>        nonce from file
      --stdout                         print results to stdout
  -h, --help                           print help
  -V, --version                        print version
```

## Examples

> You have to provide 32 characters (bytes) long key and 12 characters (bytes)
long nonce. You can provide them from file or from stdin during program
execution.

### Encrypt file

```shell
nutek-cipher -e -i file.txt -o file.txt.enc
```

### Decrypt file

```shell
nutek-cipher -d -i file.txt.enc -o file.txt
```

### Encrypt text

```shell
echo "I ‚ù§Ô∏è you" | nutek-cipher -e --stdout
```

### Decrypt text

```shell
echo "_your_encrypted_content_" | nutek-cipher -d --stdout
```
