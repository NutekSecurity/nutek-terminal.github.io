# fwknop

## description

fwknop is a tool for implementing a single packet authorization scheme for network services. It is designed to be used in situations where a network service needs to be protected from unauthorized access, but the client is not able to use a more secure authentication scheme such as SSH public key authentication or SSL client certificates.

brew install fwknop
```
